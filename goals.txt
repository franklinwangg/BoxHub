get rid of the "boxing-forum" thing


make reply button functionality for comments

add a "comment-level" property to the comments

first look for comments that have no parents, lay them all out (and take them out the list)




create replies to comments

so each comment will have an attribute of "parentComment", and thus will be nested under the parentComment
